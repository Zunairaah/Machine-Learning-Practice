1. KNN: Non-parametric algorithm classifying data based on majority of K nearest neighbors.
   
2. Random Forest: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for robust classification or regression.

3. Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier assuming feature independence, based on Bayes' theorem.

4. SVM: Supervised learning algorithm maximizing margin to find optimal hyperplane for classification.
